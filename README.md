# dotaWikiFetcher

This program aims to fetch information from the Dota 2 wiki (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki) 
and change it into a convenient json format.

This should allow things like bots to access Dota 2 information without using the more complicated official
Dota 2 API.

In the future, this program should output scalable html files that are ready to be embedded on a webpage or 
online chatroom.
